# TASK 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
## Description: 
with help of python(panda) I convert a raw data into processed data using some vital cleaning techniques, Such as
 + Rename Column Head, 
 + Reorder the Columns, 
 + Fix Data Type, 
 + Standardizing the Data, 
 + Correcting inconsistencies, 
 + Remove Duplicates and 
 + Handle Missing values as well.
I check whether it has any Duplicate value or Null value likely, I can't find any duplicate value or missing value in this dataset but it has other difficulties like, poor columns head and order of the columns, I fix that with codes and I performing data standardization and fixing data type, correcting inconsistencies using Python's Pandas Library. 
   
You can find the Python code for this Data processing and Cleaned Dataset in the **Notebook.ipynb** file included in this repository and I also attached unfiltered raw dataset file as **Raw Data of Customer Personality Analysis** in this same repositary.
