# TASK 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
## Description: 
with help of python(panda) I convert a raw data into processed data using some vital cleaning techniques, Such as
 + Rename Column Head, 
 + Reorder the Columns, 
 + Fix Data Type, 
 + Standardizing the Data, 
 + Correcting inconsistencies, 
 + Remove Duplicates and 
 + Handle Missing values as well. likely, I can't find any duplicate value or missing value in this dataset but it has other difficulties.
   
You can find the Python code for this Data processing and processed final outcome in the **Notebook.ipynb** file included in this repository and I also attached unfiltered raw dataset file as **Raw Data of Customer Personality Analysis** in this same repositary.
## Tools Used:
